## daisyb3ll.io ☆ﾟ.*･｡

Welcome to daisyb3ll.io, my personal portfolio project! Originally launched as a simple HTML & CSS hobby project, this site has gradually evolved into the landing page for my portfolio & project showcase / blog for my future site @daisyland.design, where I plan to showcase my programming, UX/UI, and graphic design projects, and my zine projects! Currently, it features a fun 8-bit theme, but is **under construction** ! 
## about

This portfolio began as a self-learning exercise in web development. I initially had no intention of hosting my own portfolio—until I discovered that GitHub makes it easy to host your own websites. 
Thanks, GitHub!
