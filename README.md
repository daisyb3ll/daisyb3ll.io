# daisyb3ll.io
daisyb3ll.io is my portfolio project, initally started as an HTML&CSS hobby project, my portfolio has slowley developed into the landing psge for my site, of which I will be adding my programming, UX/UI, and graphic design work, as well as my blog page. At the moment it is 8-bit themed, but is under construction! 
## about
Initially started as a web-dev self-learnign exercise. I had never intended to ever host my own postfolio, until I learned online that you could host your own websites on github!
