            <h2>Fowler School of Engineering Collaboration with Higher Ground Youth</h2>
            <p>
                In my fall semester of 2022, I was approached by my boss at the time, Carlos Vergara- with a request to 
                participate in a design collaboration with the local HIgherGround organization chapter, to help with 
                creating kid's dream halloween costumes as a part of Prof."never-call-me-professor"Jon Humphreys 3d priting class. 
                <br></br>
                This project was divided into groups- and as such I had the wonderful opportunity to meet one of my closest friends though the 
                Collab Od Da Century with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonagoldberg/">Jackson Goldberg'22 </a>, as well as help and support 
                from <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalin-richardson/"> Kalin Richardson'26 </a>. 
                <br></br>
                Together we worked tirelessly for weeks to build the perfect halloween costume that would fit the requested description of 
                <b>"I want to be a japanese dragon!"</b>.

        <!-- As we were limited by only our budget and imagination, we had to be very resourceful when it came to materials. This
        resulted in us opting to go the
        DIY route with the use of a Stratasys J850 for high fidelity, full color, and full detail 3d prints for the dragon eyes,
        one child sized bicycle
        helment for a safe,comfortable,and secure foundation, chicken wire and pvc piping for structural support,led lights,
        interior wiring, and five trips to a craft stores worth of
        fabric, felt, needles, bobbins, markers, paint, fiber fill and glue.
        <br></br>
        
        The project was nothing short of successful.
        <br></br>
        Managing the project was a giant in itself, with no framework of reference to go off we worked quickly with the time we
        had
        (3 weeks in October). The collaboration was even featured on the news and on the <a

                Managing the project was a giant in itself, with no framework of reference to go off we worked quickly with the time we
                had (3 weeks in October).Ultimately, the planing and work payed off, as we had one very happy 'client' in our asssigned 'client',  at 
                Higher Ground, of whom gave very positive feedback to our final deliverable. >:-) 
                <br>
                The experience was very rewarding to the class cohort, as to a good amoun tof students in the seciton, it was a first of many opportunites for 
                positive comminity involvement and impact, and an insight to the fostering and facilitation of change as a result of inspiration.
                
                Having had the opportunity to recieve assistance and support from such organizations as a kid- like the Friendly Center ,Boys and Girls Club, and G.R.I.P- 
                I am constantly looking for ways to give back to the community, and to the programs that helped raise me and my peers towards success. Having had the opportunuty
                to be involved in this journey for others has been a gift, and a reminder to continue to foster growth and inclusion for others, and to inspire and lead with kindness.
