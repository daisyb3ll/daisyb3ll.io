            <p>
                In my fall semester of 2022, I was approached by my boss at the time, Carlos Vergara- with a request to 
                participate in a design collaboration with the local HIgherGround organization chapter, to help with 
                creating kid's dream halloween costumes as a part of Prof "never-call-me-professor"Jon Humphreys 3d priting class. 
                <br></br>
                The exchange went something like this.
                <br></br>
                " daisy help with this project"
                <br>
                "ok."
                <br>
                "cool thanks"
                <br></br>
                This project was divided into groups- and as such I had the wonderful opportunity to meet one of my closest friends though the 
                Collab Od Da Century with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonagoldberg/">Jackson Goldberg'22 </a>, as well as help and support 
                from <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalin-richardson/"> Kalin Richardson'26 </a>.
